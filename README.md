# PracticeFreeCodeCamp

My work in FreeCodeCamp.
This repository is not for an app, but more like a diary, where I keep track of everything I've done and learned from FreeCodeCamp. I keep the code as I solved it in the FreeCodeCamp exercises, I don't fix it or update it with new things learned since the reason for the repository is a learning diary.
